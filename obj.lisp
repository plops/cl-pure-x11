;; first i have to sort out the socket handling i have listen
;; continuously for events and parse them. use a single thread that
;; listens and sends. use two mailboxes to communicate with the rest
;; of the program


;; the server sends three types of packages back: errors, events and
;; replies. errors and events (page 176) are 32 bytes long. 

;; replies always contain a length and a sequence number. that means
;; i can easily read all replies. i can skip replies even if i didn't
;; implement a parser for them yet.
 

;; then i need some polygon handling (point in polygon test)

;; Implementation:
